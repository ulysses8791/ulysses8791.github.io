### Yuri Berest (Cornell) {#berest}

**Spaces of Quasi-invariants and Homotopy Lie Groups**

Quasi-invariants are natural geometric generalizations
of classical invariant polynomials of finite reflection
groups. They first appeared in mathematical physics
in the early 1990s, and since then have found applications
in many other areas: most notably, representation theory,
algebraic geometry and combinatorics.

In this talk, I will explain how the algebras of 
quasi-invariants can be realized topologically as 
(equivariant) cohomology rings of certain spaces naturally
attached to compact connected Lie groups.
Our main result is a generalization of a well-known theorem
of A. Borel that realizes the algebra of invariant
polynomials of a Weyl group $W$ as the cohomology ring
of the classifying space $BG$ of the corresponding Lie group
$G$. Replacing equivariant cohomology with equivariant
$K$-theory gives multiplicative (exponential) analogues of 
quasi-invariants, and, in fact, quasi-invariants can be
defined for an arbitrary generalized (complex oriented)
cohomology theory. Most interesting perhaps is the fact
that the spaces of quasi-invariants can be also constructed 
for some non-Coxeter ($p$-adic) pseudo-reflection groups,
in which case the compact Lie groups are replaced
by $p$-compact groups — remarkable homotopy-theoretic
objects a.k.a. homotopy Lie groups. Topological
realization of rings of quasi-invariants raises natural
questions about topological ('higher algebraic') refinements
of basic properties of these rings and related structures.
Time permitting, I will discuss some of these questions
in the context of stable homotopy theory.

(Based on joint work with Ajay C. Ramadoss.)

**Hypersurface deformation structures and space-time models**

Deformations of spacelike hypersurfaces in space-time have
recently been shown to form an $L_\infty$ algebroid.
Space-time models for gravitational field theories, however,
are commonly derived and analyzed using a Poisson bracket.
The discrepancy may have implications for physics questions
such as the nature of black-hole singularities.

**Covariant spacetime models in modified gravity: Spherical symmetry**

General covariance is the underlying mathematical principle
of general relativistic theories with physical implications
that are currently still being discovered more than a century
after its conception. We will discuss how the canonical formulation
of general covariance leads to several conditions on the constraints
of modified theories of gravity which, in turn, determine modified 
spacetimes; in particular, these conditions can be solved exactly
for the most general Hamiltonian constraint for spherically symmetric
models up to second order derivatives of the gravitational variables
in vacuum. The allowed modifications are strongly restricted and 
include some previous studies on inverse-triad corrections and 
holonomy-modifications motivated by loop quantum gravity with black 
hole solutions free of singularity. We also discuss a local, off-shell 
partial Abelianization of the constraint algebra intended as first step 
to facilitate quantization which imposes some conditions on the general 
constraint's free parameters with implications on the spacetime 
structure including a natural relativistic extension of the modified 
Newtonian dynamics approach to the dark matter problem.

**Coisotropicity of fixed points under torus action on the
variety of Lagrangian subalgebras**

I will talk about my recent study of coisotropic subalgebras
of Lie bialgebras. Given a complex semisimple Lie algebra
$\mathfrak{g}$ with adjoint group $G$, the set of coisotropic
subalgebras of $\mathfrak{g}$ form an algebraic variety,
which is called the variety of coisotropic subalgebras.
Let $H$ be a fixed maximal torus of $G$. I will introduce
my results on fixed points of $H$-action on the variety
of coisotropic subalgebras. Approaches of toric varieties
and algebraic groups will be used.

### Ralph Kaufmann (Purdue) {#kaufmann}

**Algebraic structures on the Tate-Hochschild complex**

There are a set of operations on the Tate-Hochschild complex
of a Frobenius algebra which were defined by Rivera and Wang.
These fit into a larger family of operations which contains
a bibracket. A related bibracket also appears in the work
of Iyudu, Kontsevich, Vlassoupolous.
The larger family comes from cellularizations
of moduli spaces and their partial compactifications.
Combinatorially the cells are given by graphs.
Such graphs act on Hochschild cochains providing algebraic
string topology operations. These can be dualized to act
on Hochschild chains.
Using a connecting differential the action descends
to the Tate-Hochschild complex.
We explain these constructions
and give a graphical calculus for them.

### Eugenio Landi (Penn State) {#landi}

**The Topological Half of the Grothendieck-Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch Theorem**

The HRR theorem famously states that the holomorphic Euler characteristic
of X with coefficients in a holomorphic vector bundle V equals
$\int_X\operatorname{ch}(V)\operatorname{td}(X)$.
This can be rewritten as two theorems: the first one, analytical,
identifying $\chi(X,V)$ with the K-theoretic pushforward of V to the point,
while the second, purely topological, identifying the pushforward with the integral.
The same can be said for the GHRR theorem and pushforwards along proper holomorphic
maps between holomorphic manifolds. I will focus on the second half, introducing
orientations and pushforwards in cohomology and explaining how the presence
of the Todd class is natural and expected.

### Yun Liu (Cornell) {#liu}

**Generalized Spaces of Quasi-invariants**

Abstract:
In a recent work, Yu. Berest and A. C. Ramadoss [BR] formulated
and studied the realization problem for rings of quasi-invariants
of finite reflection groups in terms of classifying spaces
of compact Lie groups and their classical homotopy-theoretic
generalizations: finite loop spaces and p-compact groups.
The main tool used in [BR] is the fiber-cofiber construction
introduced in topology by T. Ganea.

In the first part of this talk, which is based on joint work
with Yu. Berest and A. C. Ramadoss, we will describe a natural
generalization of the fiber-cofiber construction in the context
of abstract homotopy theory. Then, in the second part, we will show
how to apply this generalized fiber-cofiber construction to obtain
analogues of spaces of quasi-invariants associated with classical
sphere fibrations. The rational cohomology rings of these
generalized spaces of quasi-invariants have nice algebraic
properties that are similar to those of classical quasi-invariants.
Time permitting we will describe these properties
in a number of examples and discuss potential applications.

### Markus Pflaum (Colorado Boulder) {#pflaum}

**Deformation Quantization and Homological Reduction of a Lattice Gauge Model**

In the first part of the talk we explain the method of homological reduction and its
quantized version. We then show that quantized homological reduction can be applied
to construct deformation quantizations of certain singular symplectic spaces,
namely singular symplectic quotients, where the coefficients of the moment map define
a complete intersection.
In the second part of the talk examples are discussed, among others one where the
singularity type is worse than an orbifold singularity and a lattice gauge model.
We also present a few new results on equivariant analytic structures on symplectic
manifolds and the analyticity of the moment map.

**Representation homology, derived character maps and symmetric homology**

We give a new construction (in terms of functor homology)
of the derived character maps between the cyclic homology
and representation homology of (group algebras of) simplicial groups.
For one dimensional representations, these derived character maps
factor through symmetric homology. In this case, we show
that these maps are of topological origin: they are induced
(on homologies) by natural maps of (iterated) loop spaces
that are well studied in homotopy theory. Using this topological
interpretation, we show that the symmetric homology of any associative
algebra (over a field of characteristic $0$) is isomorphic to its
one-dimensional representation homology. As a consequence, we compute
the symmetric homology of universal enveloping algebras. We use these
results to settle two conjectures of Fiedorowicz and Ault over fields
of characterictic $0$. 

This is joint work with Yuri Berest.

### Manuel Rivera (Purdue) {#rivera}

**An algebraic model for the free loop space**

I will describe an algebraic construction that models the passage
from a topological space to its free loop space, without imposing
any restrictions on the underlying space. The input of the construction
is a "curved coalgebra" over an arbitrary ring R equipped with additional
structure and satisfying certain properties. The output is an R-chain
complex equipped with a "rotation" operator. The construction is
a modified version of the coHochschild complex of a conilpotent
coalgebra and is invariant with respect to a notion of weak equivalence
for coalgebras drawn from Koszul duality theory. When this construction
is applied to a suitable model for the coalgebra of chains
of an arbitrary simplicial set X (possibly non-simply connected
and non-fibrant) one obtains a chain complex that is quasi-isomorphic
to the singular chains on the free loop space of the geometric realization
of X. The construction is as small as it can be. Time permitting,
we also discuss the relationship with Ed Brown's twisted tensor product
model in terms of the holonomy of the free loop space fibration
given by the conjugation action of (a suitable model for) the based
loop space on itself. This model for the free loop space is potentially
useful in studying invariants arising in string topology of non-simply
connected manifolds, some of which are able to distinguish homotopy
equivalent non-homeomorphic manifolds.

**Formal exponential maps and the Atiyah class of dg manifolds**

Exponential maps arise naturally in the contexts of Lie theory and 
smooth manifolds. The infinite jets of these classical exponential 
maps are related to Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt isomorphism and the 
complete symbols of differential operators.

We will investigate the question on how to extend these maps to dg 
manifolds. As an application, we will show there is an $L_\infty$ 
structure on the space of vector fields in connection with the Atiyah 
class of a dg manifold. 

In particular, for the dg manifold arising from a foliation, we induce 
an $L_\infty$ structure on the deRham complex associated with the 
foliation. As a special case, it is related to Kapranov's $L_\infty$ 
structure on the Dolbeault complex of a Kähler manifold.

This is a joint work with Mathieu Stiénon and Ping Xu.

**From Lie algebra crossed modules to tensor hierarchies**

Gauging procedures in supergravity produced what are known as tensor hierarchies.
These rely on a pairing - called an embedding tensor - between a Leibniz algebra
and a Lie algebra. The combination forms a triple called a Lie-Leibniz triple,
of which Lie algebra crossed modules are particular cases. Here we show
that any Lie-Leibniz triple induces a differential graded Lie algebra -
its associated tensor hierarchy - whose restriction to the category of Lie algebra
crossed modules is the canonical assignment of a 2-term differential graded Lie algebra
to a Lie algebra crossed module. This construction of such tensor hierarchies
we find clearer and more straightforward than previous derivations and suggests
the existence of further well-defined Leibniz gauge theories.

This is a joint work with Sylvain Lavau.

### Artur Tsobanjan (King's College Wilkes-Barre) {#tsobanjan}

**Quantum dynamical reduction**

Canonical approaches to reconciling quantum mechanics 
with general relativity run into the so-called problem of time 
(amongst other issues). The structural reason for this problem 
is that general relativity, formulated as a dynamical theory, 
is invariant under arbitrary time reparameterization. This 
particular issue can be studied in isolation using "toy models" 
that possess time-reparameterization invariance without other 
complications. In canonical formulation on a symplectic phase 
space such systems invariably possess a Hamiltonian constraint: 
their Hamiltonian is constrained to vanish and therefore can be 
re-scaled, making the time parameterization of the associated 
dynamical orbits arbitrary. Such a system appears to call for a 
symplectic reduction by the symplectic flow of the Hamiltonian 
constraint. In my talk I will explain why what we need instead 
is a special kind of "dynamical" reduction, accomplished by 
selecting a "clock" function to keep track of time. The main 
interest here is a precise mathematical formulation of the 
quantum counterpart to the dynamical reduction, and I will 
focus on one recent proposal for such a construction. However, 
as we will see, the problem remains open: even in the simplest 
models, this version of quantum dynamical reduction (and others 
that it generalizes) does not seem to fully capture the 
time-reparameterization freedom of its classical counterpart.

### Victor Turchin (Kansas State) {#turchin}

**Rational homotopy theory invariants of embedding spaces**

Abstract: Manifold functor calculus was invented by Goodwillie 
and Weiss in 1990s in order to study embedding spaces. A deep 
result by Goodwillie, Klein and Weiss asserts that the method 
is applicable whenever the codimension is $>2$. Later, around 
2011 the calculus was translated to the language of operads by 
Boavida and Weiss as well as independently by Arone and me. 
Together with the (relative) formality of the little discs 
operad this gave an efficient way to study spaces of embeddings 
of manifolds in Euclidean space. The most advanced and 
technically most difficult results in this direction are 
contained in my joint work with Fresse and Willwacher
"On the rational homotopy type of embedding spaces
of manifolds in $\mathbb{R}^n$" [+].
For a manifold $M$ and an ambient dimension $n$, we define a 
graph-complex $L_\infty$ algebra $\operatorname{HGC}_{M,n}$, such that the 
rational homotopy type of each component of the embedding space 
is computed as a twist of $\operatorname{HGC}_{M,n}$ by some Maurer-Cartan 
element. The corresponding MC element modulo gauge relations
MC/~  under some codimension restrictions happens to be a 
finite-to-one invariant of embeddings. This invariant is 
conjectured to be related to many interesting geometric 
invariants, such as linking number (in case $M$ has several 
components), higher linking Milnor invariants, 
Boéchat-Haefliger invariants of embeddings of 4-folds in $\mathbb{R}^7$, 
Whitney-Skopenkov invariants of 3-folds in $\mathbb{R}^6$, Vassiliev and 
TQFT invariants of long $(k-2)$-knots in $\mathbb{R}^k$, etc. In my talk I 
will describe the graph-complex $\operatorname{HGC}_{M,n}$ and will state the 
main results of [+]. Some examples will then be considered.

(Joint work with B. Fresse and T. Willwacher.)

### Jingfeng Xia (Temple) {#xia}

**Exploration of Grothendieck-Teichmueller(GT) shadows related to the full modular group**

In this talk, we will introduce $GT$-shadows and the groupoid $GTSh$.
We will see that the groupoid $GTSh$ is highly disconnected.
Consider an onto group homomorphism $\psi$ from the Artin Braid group $B_3$
to the full modular group $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$, where
$$\psi(\sigma_1)=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix},
\qquad \psi(\sigma_2)=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix},$$
and the standard projection
$P_q: SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) \longrightarrow SL_2(\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})$
for positive integer $q$. We get a map of posets from the divisibility poset
of positive integers to the poset $NFI_{PB_3}(B_3)$ of finite index
normal subgroups of $B_3$ contained in $PB_3$. We will consider a certain
subposet of $NFI_{PB_3}(B_3)$, and we will describe the connected components
of certain elements of that subposet in $GTSh$.
