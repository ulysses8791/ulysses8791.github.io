# Conference on 'Dg-manifolds in Geometry and Physics'

Part of the [thematic trimester `Higher Structures in Geometry and Mathematical Physics'](ADD_LINK_HERE)

July 3-7, 2023 @ [Institut Henri Poincaré](https://www.ihp.fr) in Paris

This conference intends to bring together mathematicians that solve questions
in differential geometry or theoretical physics using dg-manifolds
(or related objects) as a tool. Dg-manifolds, also called Q-manifolds,
or Lie infinity-algebroids, have been proved to be both powerful and efficient:
we think that the time has come to recapitulate the miscellaneous applications
of the concept that have appeared in the previous ten years.
