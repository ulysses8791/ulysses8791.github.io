**d-critical structure(s) on the Quot scheme of points on a Calabi-Yau 3-fold**

D-critical schemes and Artin stacks were introduced by Joyce in 2015, and play a central role in Donaldson-Thomas theory. They typically occur as truncations of (-1)-shifted symplectic derived schemes, but the problem of constructing the d-critical structure on a "DT moduli space" without passing through derived geometry (which is hard) is wide open. We discuss this and related problems, and new results in this direction, when the moduli space is the Quot scheme of points on a Calabi-Yau 3-fold. Joint work with Michail Savvas.

**Desingularisation of sheaves and reduced Gromov--Witten invariants**

Gromov--Witten (GW) invariants of genus g, with g greater than one, do not count curves of genus g in a given space: curves of lower genus also contribute to GW invariants. In genus one this problem was corrected by Vakil and Zinger, who defined more enumerative numbers called "reduced GW invariants." More recently Hu, Li and Niu gave a construction of reduced GW invariants in genus two. I will define reduced Gromov--Witten invariants in all genera. This is work with A. Cobos-Rabano, E. Mann and R. Picciotto.

**Do we want a new foundation for "higher structures"?**

The fundamental theorem of category theory is the Yoneda lemma, which in its simplest form identifies natural transformations between represented functors with morphisms between the representing objects. The $\infty$-categorical Yoneda lemma is surprisingly hard to prove --- at least in the traditional set-based foundations of mathematics. In this talk we'll describe the experience of developing $\infty$-category theory in an alternate foundation system based on homotopy type theory, in which constructions determined up to a contractible space of choices are genuinely "well-defined" and elementwise mappings are automatically homotopically-coherently functorial. In this setting the proof the $\infty$-categorical Yoneda lemma is arguably easier than the 1-categorical Yoneda lemma. We'll end by posing the question as to whether similar foundations would be useful for other "higher structures." This is based on joint work with Mike Shulman and involves computer formalizations written in collaboration with Nikolai Kudasov and Jonathan Weinberger.

**A theory of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants for orbifold Calabi-Yau threefolds**

We define integer valued invariants of an orbifold Calabi-Yau threefold $X$ with transverse ADE orbifold points. These invariants contain equivalent information to the Gromov-Witten invariants of $X$ and are related by a Gopakumar-Vafa like formula which may be regarded as a universal multiple cover / degenerate contribution formula for orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants. We also give sheaf theoretic definitions of our invariants. As examples, we give formulas for our invariants in the case of a (local) orbifold K3 surface. These new formulas generalize the classical Yau-Zaslow and Katz-Klemm-Vafa formulas. This is joint work with S. Pietromonaco.

**(-2)-shifted symplectic virtual cycles**

Behrend-Fantechi and Li-Tian showed how to produce a virtual cycle from a 2-term obstruction theory (or, in higher language, a quasi-smooth derived scheme).
I will describe joint work with Jeongseok Oh that produces a virtual cycle from a 3-term symmetric obstruction theory (or, in higher language, a (-2)-shifted symplectic derived scheme).
There is also a localisation formula, a K-theoretic refinement, a virtual GRR formula, etc.
Earlier Borisov-Joyce used real derived differential geometry to define a real virtual homology class. When their virtual dimension is even we show our class reproduces theirs; when it is odd we show their class is torsion.

**Complexes of stable $\infty$-categories**

Derived categories have come to play a decisive role in a wide range of topics. Several recent developments, in particular in the context of topological Fukaya categories, arouse the desire to study not just single categories, but rather complexes of categories. In this talk, we will discuss examples that arise in the vicinity of homological mirror symmetry, along with some results and conjectures involving them.

**QK = GV for CY3 at g=0**

In this talk, I will show that on a Calabi-Yau threefold (CY3) a genus zero quantum K-invariant (QK) can be written as an integral linear combination of a finite number of Gopakumar--Vafa BPS invariants (GV) with coefficients from an explicit multiple cover formula. Conversely, all Gopakumar--Vafa invariants can be determined by a finite number of quantum K-invariants in a similar manner. The technical heart is a proof of a remarkable conjecture by Hans Jockers and Peter Mayr.
This result is consistent with the "virtual Clemens conjecture" for the Calabi--Yau threefolds. A heuristic derivation of the relation between QK and GV via the virtual Clemens conjecture and a "multiple cover formula" will also be explained. This is a joint work with You-Cheng Chou.

### Yukinobu Toda _(Kavli IPMU)_ {#toda}

**Quasi-BPS categories for K3 surfaces**

In this talk, I will give semiorthogonal decompositions of derived categories of coherent sheaves on moduli stacks of semistable objects on K3 surfaces. An each summand is given by the categorical Hall product of subcategories called quasi-BPS categories, which approximate the categorification of BPS cohomologies for K3 surfaces. When the weight and the Mukai vector is coprime, the quasi-BPS category is shown to be smooth and proper, with trivial Serre functor etale locally on the good moduli space. So it gives a twisted analogue of categorical crepant resolution of the singular symplectic moduli space, and reminiscents categorical analogue of chi-independence phenomena. This is a joint work in progress with Tudor Padurariu.
